# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the Data Scientist job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others to find optimal jobs. 

Data is collected from [Luke Barousse's SQL Course](/https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The Questions I tried to answer through my SQL Queries were:
- [What are the top-paying remote data scientist jobs?](/sql_load/project_sql/1_top_paying_jobs.sql)
- [What skills are required for the top-paying remote data scientist jobs?](/sql_load/project_sql/2_top_paying_job_skills.sql)
- [What are the most in-demand skills for Data Scientists?](/sql_load/project_sql/3_top_demanded_skills.sql)
- [What are the top paying skills based on salary?](/sql_load/project_sql/4_top_paying_skills.sql)
- [What are the most optimal skills to learn (aka it's in high demand and a high paying skill)?](/sql_load/project_sql/5_most_optimal_skills.sql)
# Tools I used
For my deep dive into the Data Scientist job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:
- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries
- **Git & Github:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking
# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:
## 1. Top Paying Data Scientist Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data scientist positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

    name AS company_name
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    job_work_from_home = True AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
